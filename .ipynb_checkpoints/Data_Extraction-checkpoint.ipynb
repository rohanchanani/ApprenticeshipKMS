What that means is that all cardholders and agents get support from other departments. Technical support can assist as needed but only if an internal support ticket is raised. Other than that, we have a partner support queue which can be used by partners for issues or questions during integrations. The partner queue and IT queue are montiored and triaged during business hours by our technical support representative who we hired about a month ago. We also implemented an IT manager about a month ago who oversees the requests. Also, we hired a techncial support representative (hardware) about a month ago who assists with IT tickets. Prior to a month ago this was all manged by the director of product. We have an integrations manager who has been with us for about 4 years that had been the one managing the queue. Our now IT manager has been with us about 4 years and had been managing the hardware amongst other things previously. Software development managers and the director of product spend a lot of time previously assiting with technical support. The new organization and individuals were all in an effort to separate IT from Product so that there could be more focus on product without the bandwidth issues and interruptions that techncial support caused.

The director of product\" has been managing IT support and product engineering. the director of product coordinates the collection of feedback from existing customer through the it/product support infastructure.

Those requests are documented in the development backlogs. New features can come through the IT/product support channel, or from sales or the executive officers. All epics were listed on an internal \"product roadmap\" and the piorities roughly assigned. When development was ready for the next epic to begin analyzing, the director of product would work with the executive team and development mangers to determine if the next priority was the correct next item. Then, it would be mapped out into the next sprint(s) and the development managers would take over with development, testing, and delivery. Upon delivery, functionality is communicated with any applicable stakeholders.\n",

Some agents use our SFTP for transmitting files for loading card. The vast majority of our loads are through API integrations. Finally, our end cardholders. There are 80,000 new cardholders a month. Many just use their cards and don't use our system. There is heavy usage of our IVR which allows them to check balances, change PINs, etc or contact support. It is 24/7 from a technology standpoint but we only have support reps from 7-7 for normal cardholder questions. We do have 24/7 agent support and critical card issues (lost card).

      "51. What are the most common problems developers run into during the development cycle?\n",
      "As the developers are third parties we do not always get details about internal team challenges. The most common frustrations raised to us are: 1) Changing scope in the form of new tickets added to the sprint or unanticipated impact and scope of existing tickets. 2) Lack of access to servers, databases and logs necessary to troubleshoot issues.\n",

      "Our 3rd party developers have internal QA teams that test daily builds and report them to developers. When the build is deemed ready for production by our 3rd party dev teams the changes are moved to Company's QA servers. Companys QA team then does another round of testing.

      "58. What gaps exist within existing tooling, languages and frameworks?\n",
      "There are many gaps. Simply put we are not taking advantage of newer technologies and capabilities available in our programming languages, frameworks, deployments and servers.

      "The tier 1 and 2 customer success as well as account management, onboarding, and client success have all recently been changed (are in the process still) by the CEO. Ulitmately all of those represent the first level of contact for our customers with the exception of integrations and partner support. What that means is that all cardholders and agents get support from other departments. Technical support can assist as needed but only if an internal support ticket is raised. Other than that, we have a partner support queue which can be used by partners for issues or questions during integrations. The partner queue and IT queue are montiored and triaged during business hours by our technical support representative who we hired about a month ago. We also implemented an IT manager about a month ago who oversees the requests. Also, we hired a techncial support representative (hardware) about a month ago who assists with IT tickets. Prior to a month ago this was all manged by the director of product. We have an integrations manager who has been with us for about 4 years that had been the one managing the queue. Our now IT manager has been with us about 4 years and had been managing the hardware amongst other things previously. Software development managers and the director of product spend a lot of time previously assiting with technical support. The new organization and individuals were all in an effort to separate IT from Product so that there could be more focus on product without the bandwidth issues and interruptions that techncial support caused. So now there is an IT manager with essentially three team members to support customers: technical support (triage and troubleshoot), technical support (hardware/access) and integration manager.\n",

      "104. When was the last change made to this process?\n",
      "As mentioned above, the team changed/grew recently which has allowed us to put more formal processes in place. Also, we are enforcing documentation in Confluence for troubleshooting to allow for future scalability. In the past, the documentation was usually just what informaiton was documented with the resolutions.\n",

      "Most customer support is managed through the JIRA service desk queues. On top of that we do have automated monitoring, alerting in place in a couple ways. We have Automate in place, which monitors physical hardware (servers and workstations). We have an internal utility that montiors every 30 seconds for fraud, performance, etc. Applications are also montiored by Uptime.com for availability and response times. Non-critial alerts are sent into the IT queue for review during business hours. Critial alerts are sent to alerts@company.com which is our on-call process. This emails critial internal individuals and texts and calls the currently on-call individual for immediate attention.\n",

      "107. How are Critical outages handled?\n",
