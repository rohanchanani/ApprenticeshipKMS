0,1,"Describe your Product Management Organization. [Please provide any associated documentation, i.e., Organization Chart, Roles, Responsibilities & Experience.]","Product management has always ultimately been led by the chief officers. They bring in market feedback and coordinate with sales and marketing. The director of product"" has been managing IT support and product engineering. the director of product coordinates the collection of feedback from existing customer through the it/product support infastructure. Weve never had anyone solely dedicated to true product management. Just this year weve hired a product specialist and established an IT manager and support team in an effort to allow for some time dedicated toward product management. We have two software development managers, two internal QA analysts, and 4 remote development teams at an average size of 3 developers.",Product and Organization Overview,1,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
1,2,"Describe your Requirements Management Process. [Include all phases, ideation through selection, prioritization, and execution.]","Never had a formalized process. Ultimately, enhancements and bugs often come from the IT/product support processes. This may be from internal or external customer requests. Those requests are documented in the development backlogs. New features can come through the IT/product support channel, or from sales or the executive officers. All epics were listed on an internal ""product roadmap"" and the piorities roughly assigned. When development was ready for the next epic to begin analyzing, the director of product would work with the executive team and development mangers to determine if the next priority was the correct next item. Then, it would be mapped out into the next sprint(s) and the development managers would take over with development, testing, and delivery. Upon delivery, functionality is communicated with any applicable stakeholders.",Product and Organization Overview,2,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
2,3,When were the last changes made to the Requirements Management Process?,"Its not a well defined process, so its been somewhat fluid in nature. As feedback on the process was given, the process was adjusted.",Product and Organization Overview,3,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
3,4,Please provide an overview of your short- and long-term Product Roadmap.,The yearly and quarterly roadmap as well as epic backlogs can be shared. There are 3 main applications with 2 minor/new applications which each have their own roadmap.,Product and Organization Overview,4,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
4,5,"Where do ideas for new features/enhancements come from? [Are they driven by Customers, Sales/Marketing, Technology, etc.?","As mentioned in point 1/2 above, they come from all of those areas. Customers make requests through customer support, account managers and technical support. The technology team often has network and security changes that are requested as well as support mitigation requests. Sales and the executive team bring the request from the field as well as their vision of the future direction/needs.",Product and Organization Overview,5,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
5,6,Are security considerations included in Feature and Roadmap planning?,"Yes, in the past it had been mostly driven by external audit findings. Now, we have more tools and plans in place from a technology standpoint.",Product and Organization Overview,6,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
6,7,"What metrics/analytics are in place to measure customer feature use, engagement, satisfaction, etc.?","We have audit logging in place, but its rarely been used to measure customer behavior. For much of our current volume today, we are just the API services backend that is plugged into our integration partners platforms. As such, there hasnt been a huge focus on the cusomter engagement in our own interfaces. With our end customer platform, processing.network, we have monitored and analyzed a number of metrics: registrations vs loads, which tranfer types are chosen based on pricing, etc.",Product and Organization Overview,7,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
7,8,How do you describe Customer Satisfaction Levels today?,"Based on the feedback we receive, average customer satisfaction is relatively high. Most frustration comes from lack of training or poor/incomplete integrations done by integration partners.",Product and Organization Overview,8,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
8,9,What are your most common customer complaints?,"Most common complaints are when the are unable to load a card, dont know how to use a card, or about fees that may be incurred.",Product and Organization Overview,9,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
9,10,What are your most highly used and liked features?,"Our load function is really our main feature on the issuing side. For the end customer, we have a majority of customers that just use the debit card. Many utilize our IVR for support, balance checks, PIN changes, etc. About 20% of our end customers use our online banking platform for additional transfer options or account management.",Product and Organization Overview,10,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
10,11,What is your release plan or timeline?,We release on Tuesday nights. Each project roughly follows a two week sprint cycle but can adapt to shorter or longer cycles based on the epic/requirements. Items are released in the next window as soon as all testing is completed and reviews/approvals completed.,Product and Organization Overview,11,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
11,12,How are releases managed?,"We typically release per sprint although occasionally due to testing or urgent requests, multiple sprints will be merged into a single release.",Product and Organization Overview,12,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
12,13,How do you determine scope for a release?,"Most often a release is synonymous to a sprint. Its dependent on the impactfulness or co-dependancy of a particular function or epic. Usually if an epic requires more then one sprint, we release each sprint seperately and use permissions/configurations to prevent unintended impact until the entirety of the epic is released.",Product and Organization Overview,13,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
13,14,"What is your revenue model for the product? [Subscription based, one time purchase, Freemium, support fees, etc.]","There is no revenue model directly tied to the technology currently. Revenue is transactional fees incurred by the middle or end customer. The technology is the tool that enables customers to perform transactions and get the support they need. Although, we do use the technology to influence end customer behavior to encourage use of more profitable transaction options (cards, instant transfer, etc.) while still supporting the applicable free options.",Product and Organization Overview,14,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
14,15,Do you conduct Alpha/Beta tests?,We have on a very limited basis around different fee structures but not really from product usage standpoint.,Product and Organization Overview,15,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
15,16,How do you onboard new Product team members?,"We have a small team internally with very low turnover so there isnt much onboarding. Developers are all third-party organization that manage turnover and cross training. When we do bring on new individuals, we start with a high level product design training. Then we introduce them to our processes and they work closely with their manager on any questions.",Product and Organization Overview,16,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
16,17,What would be your investment priorities for a capital infusion?,"It depends on the direction we want to go. If we are going to continue to focus on being a program manger, then we would want to invest in sales/marketing and relationship managers. Our technology already meets the needs of our current space and can grow and adapt into the additional requirements of adjacent use cases. If we want to move more towards being a service provider we would need to invest in a few priorities. We would need a dedicated product team to drive product, additional development resources to enhance the technologies to be designed for better scalability, and sales/marketing to chase the ""new"" market.",Architecture and Hosting,17,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3

26,27,What are stability and availability requirements?,"We do maintenance in a set window on Tuesday nights. Otherwise we are typically up all the time. No specific SLAs other than the bank which is 3 nines if I remember correctly. Nothing that weve come up against. Pulse also requires a certain amount of uptime but also nothing that we come up against. Otherwise, its just customer perception/expectation of uptime/stability but nothing that was officially contracted.",Architecture and Hosting,27,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
27,28,What SLAs are in place?,"We have sponsor bank and Pulse SLAs for us to meet, but no commited SLAs to customers.",Architecture and Hosting,28,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
28,29,Describe the users of the system. [Who are they; what are their roles; how do they access; when do they typically work; what devices do they use?],"We have administrator users (Our employees) who do operational functions in our web portal. This is very few users and they access from desktops during business hours. Then we have our agents who access our web portals. There are a few hundred agent users which access from desktops mostly during business hours, but it is 24/7 for some of them. Some agents use our SFTP for transmitting files for loading card. The vast majority of our loads are through API integrations. Finally, our end cardholders. There are 80,000 new cardholders a month. Many just use their cards and dont use our system. There is heavy usage of our IVR which allows them to check balances, change PINs, etc or contact support. It is 24/7 from a technology standpoint but we only have support reps from 7-7 for normal cardholder questions. We do have 24/7 agent support and critical card issues (lost card).

56,57,What are the strengths and weaknesses within your dev teams today?,"Strengths: All our teams have lead developers with many years of experience on the platforms and in the code bases.
As they are 3rd parties we dont have to worry about staffing or HR problems. But the  relationship does make us blind to some challenges and delays occurring behind the scenes.
Our india teams have significantly different work hours (time zone).
Weve had challenges getting scope and implementation reviews done before coding begins. Coders like to jump right in and start coding.",Development Practices and Tooling,57,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
57,58,"What gaps exist within existing tooling, languages and frameworks?","There are many gaps. Simply put we are not taking advantage of newer technologies and capabilities available in our programming languages, frameworks, deployments and servers. Our priorities have been new feature development and backward compatibility. The 3rd party relationship tends to put upgrades, refactoring, maintainability and standarization in the background.",Test Practices and Tooling,58,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
58,59,Is there a specific delivery or technology mindset you expect the testing team to adopt?,"No, our testing team does ""blackbox"" testing that  focuses on user acceptance of requested changes and stablility.

Part of their service is automated and manual penetration tests. On top of external penetration tests, we provide users of different permission levels so that they can test privledge escalation, sql injection, etc from within the applications as well. Example results and mitigation actions can be shared. I do think theres a weakness in their testing around APIs. Any ""critial"" issues are resolved before the audit can be closed and non-critical recommendations are scheduled in to be addressed over the next year. In the early years there were issues identified that improved our security footing, but more recent years have found only minimal recommendations with low risk.",Security,95,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3

101,102,"Describe your Customer Support and Maintenance Organization. [Org Chart, Roles, Responsibilities, Experience]","The tier 1 and 2 customer success as well as account management, onboarding, and client success have all recently been changed (are in the process still) by the CEO. Ulitmately all of those represent the first level of contact for our customers with the exception of integrations and partner support. What that means is that all cardholders and agents get support from other departments. Technical support can assist as needed but only if an internal support ticket is raised. Other than that, we have a partner support queue which can be used by partners for issues or questions during integrations. The partner queue and IT queue are montiored and triaged during business hours by our technical support representative who we hired about a month ago. We also implemented an IT manager about a month ago who oversees the requests. Also, we hired a techncial support representative (hardware) about a month ago who assists with IT tickets. Prior to a month ago this was all manged by the director of product. We have an integrations manager who has been with us for about 4 years that had been the one managing the queue. Our now IT manager has been with us about 4 years and had been managing the hardware amongst other things previously. Software development managers and the director of product spend a lot of time previously assiting with technical support. The new organization and individuals were all in an effort to separate IT from Product so that there could be more focus on product without the bandwidth issues and interruptions that techncial support caused. So now there is an IT manager with essentially three team members to support customers: technical support (triage and troubleshoot), technical support (hardware/access) and integration manager.",Customer Support/Customer Success,102,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3

103,104,When was the last change made to this process?,"As mentioned above, the team changed/grew recently which has allowed us to put more formal processes in place. Also, we are enforcing documentation in Confluence for troubleshooting to allow for future scalability. In the past, the documentation was usually just what informaiton was documented with the resolutions.",Customer Support/Customer Success,104,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3
104,105,What customer support tools are in place?,"Monitoring, Alerting, Reporting (Dashboards), etc.
Most customer support is managed through the JIRA service desk queues. On top of that we do have automated monitoring, alerting in place in a couple ways. We have Automate in place, which monitors physical hardware (servers and workstations). We have an internal utility that montiors every 30 seconds for fraud, performance, etc. Applications are also montiored by Uptime.com for availability and response times. Non-critial alerts are sent into the IT queue for review during business hours. Critial alerts are sent to alerts@company.com which is our on-call process. This emails critial internal individuals and texts and calls the currently on-call individual for immediate attention.",Customer Support/Customer Success,105,A SaaS Co.,1,R03.3

109,110,Are Business Continuity Plans in place?,"To some extent, but there is definitely room for improvement.

110,111,Provide Key Measures for availability and stability for all products and infrastructure.,"We lacking much of what I wish we had here, but we have the majority of impact addressed.

[Please provide any associated documentation, i.e., Organization Chart, Roles, Responsibilities & Experience.]","Ellis and E2L do not have a formal Product Management Organziation.  Ellis and E2L business leaders drive product developments and roadmap from a business standpoint communicating those priorities, scope and requirements to Intellitree (IT) who then creates a development plan.

114,115,"Describe your Requirements Management Process. [Include all phases, ideation through selection, prioritization, and execution.]","We do not have a formal process.  The sequence of events are typically as follows:
Business Leaders identify requirements/needs that they believe will enhance the business.
The requirements are identified and the business leader who is the internal champion, contacts IT for a quote (time, resources, and material) and to review requirements and feasibility of the project.
A quote is provided where the senior leadership, typically the CEO and CSO (depending on the scope of the project) will review, discuss and approve the scope of the project.
Business leaders enter approved projects into issue tracker, and group highest priorities into the next release target.
Developers complete the changes for the next release in version control, and deploy to production as a new version.",Product and Organization Overview,2,Ellis Partners Management Solutions,2,R03.3

Timelines for the larger features or infrastructure are more general, proceeding as time is available between the small features.",Product and Organization Overview,11,Ellis Partners Management Solutions,2,R03.3
124,125,How are releases managed?,"Everything is tracked and documented in version control, specifically Github.  The most recent production version is tracked separately from the active work on new features, so that hot fixes can be applied to the production version quickly; hot fixes are then merged back into the main development branch.  When larger features are ready to deploy, we perform a mix of automated and manual testing, and often a “beta” preview to measure user-acceptance before deploying the new version.",Product and Organization Overview,12,Ellis Partners Management Solutions,2,R03.3
125,126,How do you determine scope for a release?,"Release scope is often kept small, so that features can be released as they are completed and pass user acceptance.  Business leaders communicate the priorities to the developers, and larger features are kept on separate development branches, so that if priorities change or a feature takes longer than expected, it can be put to the side to allow a release of other smaller features.  A new release is delivered every time a useful set of changes has passed acceptance and testing.",Product and Organization Overview,13,Ellis Partners Management Solutions,2,R03.3
